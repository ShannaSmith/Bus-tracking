A map marker moves along the bus route between MIT and Harvard. This is accomplished by using the MBTA API and the Mapbox library to determine stops between Harvard & MIT and adding an animated marker to highlight the bus routes.
## How to play
  1.  Load the HTML file into your browser.
  2.  Click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button.

### Roadmap of future improvements
1.  Have map use both english and spanish to label streets and buildings.
